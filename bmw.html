          <p class="post-content">This 2001 BMW 325i was the first car I ever owned. It was sitting in the parking lot outside of Lovers Pizza, which was my first job, with a little for sale sign. I think we bought it for like 2000 dollars, but I'm not sure. I got it pretty soon after turning 16. I think it was fairly good car for me to get, I think a civic or a corrola would have been more practical but I was just so into BMWs at the time. I replaced the radio myself which was a huge hassle. I was like cutting up my hands trying to reach in there to wire it up. I rear ended someone driving on the highway. It didn't really damage anything super functional other than the hood wouldn't open super easy. We got a hood at a scrap yard and i tried replace it myself. I got it bolted on but then the latches didn't line up with the frame so it would close. Eventually i just got frustrated and just forced it shut but of course that just meant i bent the latches and it was now stuck closed. We had a shop pry it off im have no idea how they did it. but Yeah this car just means alot to me i had it from about 16-18 and that was just a really fun time of my life that i kind of miss and i miss this car.</p>
